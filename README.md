# Postttest-Probability-Shiny-App

An RShiny App for calculating posttest probabilities from binary tests (positive predictive probability). 
Multiple tests can be chained together. 
Fast mode gives only the final resulting probability while detail mode saves probabilities after each new test.
Includes a text output, datatable output and an ROC plot. 

To Do:
- 2x2 mode with Sensitivitiy calculator
- tests with multiple possible outcomes
- implement fast and detail correctly in the text output
- add xslx download format
- interactive plot design?
- plot 2x2 table?
